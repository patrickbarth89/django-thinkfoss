## Development Environment
Its super easy to set up our development environment

## Collect Pre-requisites
Install `python-pip`, `python-dev` and `virtualenvwrapper`
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev memcached
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
## Get the files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinkfoss/website
```
## Setup development environment
First, some initialization steps. Most of this only needs to be done
one time. You will want to add the command to source
`/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` to your shell startup file
(`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) changing the path to `virtualenvwrapper.sh`
depending on where it was installed by `pip`.
```bash
export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
Lets create a virtual environment for our project
```bash
mkvirtualenv thinkfoss
workon thinkfoss
```
